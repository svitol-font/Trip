Trip solidity

Code designed for travel agents. The purpose of the platform is to connect tourism service providers to the end user. For this trial version you can book up to 190 trips.

Service providers select an available id and can create the trip. They can change and update trip data at any time.

There is an owner of contract who has limited powers. He can only cancel trips created by service providers if the period of inactivity exceeds 3 months.

Users can book and cancel before the start of the trip. If they cancel the trip the amount paid is returned to the user's wallet. Users can pay the service providers from the date of start of trip.

Service providers can withdraw at any time by selecting the trip id.

NB The ticket id corresponds to the trip id.
